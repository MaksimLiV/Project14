# Project 14: SpriteKit Game

## Overview

Project 14 is a simple 2D game built using Apple's SpriteKit framework. The game is presented with a scene, where the FPS and node count are displayed for debugging purposes. The game is designed to work across both iPhones and iPads, with proper handling of screen orientation.

## Features
